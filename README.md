## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Pei Shan!

🚀 **Full Stack Developer | Final Year Student of Universiti Malaya**

I love building clean, functional, and user-centered applications — from intuitive admin dashboards to real-time interactive systems.  
Most of my work revolves around **Laravel Livewire**, **TailwindCSS (Metronic integration)**, and **modern frontend experiences** powered by **React**.

### 🧠 What I Do

- ⚙️ **Backend**
  - Dynamic modals, tables, and form-based models
  - Real-time syncing (events, vendors, users, transactions)
  - Clean component-based logic — I like things *reusable and predictable*.

- 💻 **Frontend**
  - Elegant UI using **Metronic Tailwind**
  - Smooth user interactions (search dropdowns, toggle views, charts)

### 🧩 Projects I’ve Worked On

#### 🌳 **Durian Farm Management System (Laravel)**
A full-featured farm tracking system designed to monitor trees, species, and fruit yield in real time.  
Includes live table refresh, species classification, and plantation insights for better farm management.

#### 🎟️ **Event Management System (Laravel)**
A complete event ecosystem — handling vendor participation, tier systems, check-ins, redemptions, and transaction statistics.  
Built with **Laravel Livewire** for dynamic updates and **Metronic Tailwind** for a consistent UI experience.

#### 🍔 **F&B Management System (AWS)**
Serverless restaurant order queue system powered by **AWS Lambda** and **DynamoDB**.  
Manages live customer orders, dish preparation tracking, and completion status in real time — fully integrated with API Gateway and CORS-handled APIs.

### 🎯 Development Philosophy

> *“Clean structure, clear logic, and seamless UI — every detail matters.”*

I believe code should **look good, feel good, and perform well**.  
I’m always learning, improving, and finding ways to make my projects more elegant and efficient.
